avocado framework tests for qemu display devices
================================================

configuration
-------------

Uses environment variables.

QEMU_BUILD_DIR (required)

    Should points to a qemu build tree.  The python module and qemu
    binaries are used.

    Pointing to a qemu source tree works too.  In that case only the
    python module is used.

LINUX_BUILD_DIR (optional)

    Points to a linux kernel build tree.  Uses that kernel (instead of
    the host kernel) for testing.

run the tests
-------------

avocado run *.py
