avocado framework tests for qemu display devices
================================================


run the tests
-------------

avocado run *.py


configuration
-------------

Tests can be configured using two environment variables.

QEMU_BINARY (optional)
    Points to a qemu binary to use.

QEMU_BUILD_DIR (optional)
    Points to a qemu build tree.  Uses the qemu binaries there for
    testing (instead of the installed version).

LINUX_BUILD_DIR (optional)
    Points to a linux kernel build tree.  Uses that kernel (instead of
    the host kernel) for testing.


vgpu test
---------

If a intel vgpu mdev with uuid 656527d9-c2c9-4745-b16a-00419a5bc32e is
present it will be used to run the tests.  So, just create one and
make sure the device permissions (/dev/vfio/$nr) allow the user
running the tests access it.
